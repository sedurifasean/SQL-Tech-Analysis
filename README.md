## **Project Summary** <br />
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of company acquisitions to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform strategic business decisions. The dataset includes details about the parent companies, acquired companies, acquisition dates, business categories, countries, and acquisition prices. By leveraging SQL for data cleaning, exploration, aggregation, and advanced analysis, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of acquisition activities and their implications.

## **Dataset** <br />
The dataset used for this analysis is acquisitions_update_2021.csv. Below is a brief overview of the columns in the dataset:
- ID: Unique identifier for each acquisition record
- Parent Company: The company that made the acquisition
- Acquisition Year: The year the acquisition was made
- Acquisition Month: The month the acquisition was made
- Acquired Company: The company that was acquired
- Business: The business category of the acquired company
- Country: The country where the acquisition took place
- Acquisition Price: The price of the acquisition
- Category: Additional category information
- Derived Products: Products derived from the acquisition

## **Objectives** <br />
1. Data Cleaning: Scripts in this section handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats.

2. Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis scripts provide descriptive statistics and initial insights into the dataset.

3. Aggregation: Aggregation scripts summarize data by various dimensions, such as monthly trends and department-wise summaries.

4. Joins: Joining scripts combine data from the main dataset with additional tables to provide a richer dataset for analysis.

5. Window Functions: Advanced analytical scripts use window functions to calculate running totals, moving averages, and other metrics.

6. Data Analysis: Data analysis scripts answer specific business questions, such as identifying high-cost patients and analyzing patient visit trends.

7. Table Schema Creation: Creating table with specified columns and variables.
